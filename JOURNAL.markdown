I hadn't looked at this project in quite some time.

I glanced through it and noticed that I am using Slop in it.  I remember being disappointed by the updates to Slop and that it broke the interface for one of my other scripts.  So, I will have to do some testing to see whether to bother keeping it in this project.

I also don't remember what I was doing with the classes, so I'll review the code and document some of the interfaces I was trying to create between some of the classes.  It seems like there is data being collected in various parts of the app that is then all passed back out to the command-line processor.  I'll have to also review whether this is a good fit for this application.  I don't want to have to parser the returns from the other functions.
